            Custom SKLearn Pipeline Transform function for hand pose data.

            Use the wrist landmark as the origin of the coordinate system.  Shift all hand positions
            to be relative to the wrist.  Scale the max landmark position to have a 3D length = 1
            from the wrist-origin.

            Assumes input data is tabular with each landmark's x, y, & z coords flattened into
            three separate columns.  Also assumes wrist position's z coord is already nearly 0.
